# MEDP33100 - Final Project, Public Archive

## Live Demo

https://final-project-notes-app.onrender.com/

## Project Overview

"that damn notes app" is an archival website made for users to anonymously post a random note from their notes app. It's intended to be fun, spontaneous, a bit bizarre, and easy to use.

This project thoroughly demonstrates my ability to integrate front-end styling and decisions with back-end data handling and custom API routes, using document-oriented NoSQL databases like MongoDB to store user data, and cloud platforms like Render.com to host this application. 

## Endpoints

API Endpoints utilized in this application include:
GET /: This was used to render the main page and retrieve all notes in the database. Query parameters that allow users to search for specific notes by text and filter by category are functional by the utilization of this endpoint as well.

POST /entry: Used to accept any new note entry submitted and send it to the MongoDB database.

## Technologies Used

    - **Languages**: Handlebars, CSS, JavaScript, JSON
    - **Libraries**: Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
    - **Other**: Render (deployment), Adobe Illustrator (SVG graphics)

## Credits

All graphic design by me. AI was used as support to help tweak and refine design details in CSS and Handlebars.

## Future Enhancements

I honestly would have loved to add more styling to the header, but at the same time I was conflicted. I do think the simplicity of the overall website actually makes it very straight to the point and easy to understand comparatively to if I had made it more artistically complex.
